BUILDING FOR EPIPHANY SUPPORT:

autogen.sh --enable-epiphanyscrypt

If you want to use the experimentals Epiphany ASM routines add --enable-epiphanyasm.

Also you can test if Epiphany is working fine, if you add to CPPFLAGS:
"-DEPIPHANY_DEBUG". You must be aware that this is only for debug purposes and
that it will drop a lot of performance. For normal use please don't use
this flag.


RUN with EPIPHANY SUPPORT:

You should run with "sudo -E" the script e-run.sh. The script supports the
same parameters of cgminer and it only sets a couple of variables needed to run
the Epiphany code.
