BUILDING FOR EPIPHANY SUPPORT:

autogen.sh --enable-epiphanyscrypt

If you want to use the experimentals Epiphany ASM routines add --enable-epiphanyasm.

Also you can test if Epiphany is working fine, if you add to CPPFLAGS: "-DEPIPHANY_DEBUG". You must be aware that this is only for debug purposes and that it will drop a lot of performance.

RUN with EPIPHANY SUPPORT:

You should run with "SUDO -E" the script e-run.sh. The script supports the same parameters of cgminer and only it sets a couple of variables needed in order to run the Epiphany code.
